# Technical Screening Submission - Abhishek Aryal

## Initial Estimate

- This is my current estimation for the timeline of the project.
  - Frontend 4 hours.
  - Backend: 7 hours
  - Git, writeup + misc: 1 hour
  - Total: 12 hour.

## Personal Additions

- Added HawkID field. So each submission can be traced to a unique employee.
- Disabled the submit button until all 3 fields (HawkID, Date, Receipt) are filled for an intuitive user experience.
- Put sql injection proof query.

## Design

- Generated the general design idea for the web app using Figma.
- Used University of Iowa [Brand Manual](https://brand.uiowa.edu/color) for font, color, and logo.
- Time taken: 1 hour.

## Frontend

**Tools used:** ReactJS, Bootstrap, CSS, React-Bootstrap

- The current design looks different from what I had initially designed.
  - After doing some research for frontend design I found the react-bootstrap form components.
